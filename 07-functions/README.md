# **What is a Function in Python?**

A **function** in Python is a **block of reusable code** that performs a specific task. Instead of writing the same code again and again, you can **define it once** inside a function and **call it whenever needed**.

## **Why Do We Use Functions?**

We use functions to:

1. **Avoid repetition** of code.
2. **Organize code** into smaller, manageable parts.
3. **Improve readability** and make code easier to understand.
4. **Debug easily** since each function can be tested independently.
5. **Reuse logic** without rewriting the whole block of code.

## **Benefits of Using Functions:**

| Benefit               | Description                                                          |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üß† Code Reusability   | Write once, use many times.                                          |
| üì¶ Modularity         | Break large programs into smaller, functional parts.                 |
| üîç Easy Maintenance   | Fix bugs in one place instead of all repeated spots.                 |
| üß™ Easy Testing       | Each function can be tested independently.                           |
| üìñ Better Readability | Functions with meaningful names describe what the code is doing.     |
| üöÄ Faster Development | You can build complex programs faster by reusing existing functions. |

## **Types of Functions:**

#### 1. Built-in Functions

These are pre-defined functions provided by Python.

- Examples: `print()`, `len()`, `type()`, `input()`, `sum()`, `max()`, `min()` etc.

#### 2. User-defined Functions

These are functions that **you create yourself** using the `def` keyword.

- Used to perform custom tasks and organize code logically.

#### 3. Recursive Functions

Functions that **call themselves** within their own definition.

- Used for problems that can be broken down into smaller sub-problems (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci).

#### 4. Lambda Functions (Anonymous Functions)

These are **small, unnamed functions** defined using the `lambda` keyword.

- Often used for short, simple operations.

#### 5. Built-in Class Methods / Object Methods

Functions that are **associated with objects**.

- Examples: `"hello".upper()`, `list.append()`, `dict.keys()`.

#### 6. Nested Functions (Inner Functions)

Functions defined **inside other functions**.

- Useful for encapsulation and scope control.

#### 7. Higher-order Functions

Functions that:

- **Take other functions as arguments**, or
- **Return functions as results**.
- Example: `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`

#### 8. Generator Functions

Defined like regular functions but use the `yield` keyword instead of `return`.

- Used to **generate values one at a time** (good for memory efficiency).
